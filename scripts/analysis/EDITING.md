# Editing the foundation

For changing the foundation's SQL under `sql/`. If you're writing an analysis on top of the foundation, you want [README.md](README.md) instead — this file is about the foundation itself.

[`analytics.sql`](sql/analytics.sql) is the manifest: one `.read` per file in dependency order, and the only place load order is stated — no file `.read`s another. The layer files are [`staging.sql`](sql/staging.sql) (liveness + staging macros, the `stg` schema), the generated `entity_registry.sql`, [`catalog.sql`](sql/catalog.sql) (the catalog spine), [`prose.sql`](sql/prose.sql) (the wikilink graph and prose tokenization), the generated `shared_hosts.sql`, [`provenance.sql`](sql/provenance.sql) and [`data_patches.sql`](sql/data_patches.sql). Each layer's checks live in its `*_checks.sql` file as a private view; [`foundation_checks.sql`](sql/foundation_checks.sql) folds them into the one public gate and adds the cross-layer checks. [`audit.sql`](sql/audit.sql), [`run_context.sql`](sql/run_context.sql) — `analysis_context`, which belongs to no layer and reads the public views of all of them — and [`relation_index.sql`](sql/relation_index.sql) load last, in that order: the index records the relations that exist when it runs, so nothing may be defined after it.

## What this layer is

**The public layer is semantic, not staging.** There's a private staging layer that mirrors its source one view per table. The public layer, though, adds a lot to make it more ergonomic and harder to arrive at a confident wrong answer: decoding (FK to slug, JSON to column, polymorphic id to typed subject), declaring grains, deriving measures, and documenting traps that would otherwise return a confident wrong answer.

**Join the live-filtered view, never re-filter the physical table.** `AND x.status IS DISTINCT FROM 'deleted'` on a join is a second copy of the liveness rule, which belongs inside `_staging()` and nowhere else. There are no exceptions left: the layer spells that predicate exactly once, in the `is_live` macro in `staging.sql`.

**Which view you join is a layer question: the staging view to decode an identity, the entity view to read a measure.** An entity view carries both the entity and measures over the models beneath it (`manufacturers.n_models`, `titles.n_models`, `themes.n`). Identity points sideways, measures point down at `models` — so joining an entity view for a neighbour's slug drags its aggregate along, and that is what used to make `models` joining `titles` circular. The `stg` schema exists to break that: a bare read of one table, no joins, no measures, no outgoing edge, so nothing that reads one can be part of a cycle. `staging_view_not_flat` asserts the shape, because a join added to a staging view fails silently — the view still returns the right rows, and the cycle only surfaces later in whatever unrelated view next tries to compose.

A staging view is for a table **more than one view reads**. `cabinets` IS `_staging('raw.catalog_cabinet')` and a `stg.cabinet` would be pure indirection; the layer makes a shared read shared, it doesn't wrap every table.

Ordering follows from the same graph, and it is not optional: views bind at `CREATE`, so a dependency defined lower in the file is a Catalog Error at load. That is the one good thing about this class of mistake — it is loud and it names the view and the line. What is NOT loud is a composed view quietly returning different rows, so a change of this kind gets diffed against the view it replaces, not just loaded.

## What belongs in the foundation

**The foundation carries counts and mechanics; consumers carry thresholds and semantics.**

The recurring temptation when an analysis finds a gap is to fold its judgment into the foundation alongside the fact — a manufacturer "era" that quietly requires 3 dated models, an `alone_in_title` boolean, a stem macro encoding one manufacturer's numbering convention. Each is right for the consumer that needs it and lossy for the next one, which inherits a cutoff it never chose and can't see.

So: if a proposed column encodes a cutoff, a per-manufacturer convention or a yes/no a query could express in one predicate, surface the underlying number instead and let the caller write the predicate. `titles.n_models` is the pattern — the foundation gives the count, the analysis writes `n_models = 1`; `models.title_size` is the same number at model grain, and `title_size = 1` is the "alone in its Title" test. `manufacturers` gives `year_of_first_model`/`year_of_last_model` **and** `n_dated`, so a consumer can demand whatever evidence it wants. Judgment belongs in an analysis's Reference lookup table, where the checks can see it, not in a macro that answers confidently for inputs it was never calibrated on.

The same rule sets the bar for **macros**, of which there are few: the name-normalization block (`name_norm`, `name_strip_paren`, `name_key`) exists because every cross-record comparison needs one and hand-rolled copies drift. Matching _strategy_ — plural collapsing, token subsets, edit distance — stays analysis-local.

**Test a macro by its outcome, not by its mechanism.** A smoke check that feeds a macro a fixture proves the two lines do what the two lines say, which is the least likely thing to break; the realistic failure is a view that bypasses the macro, and no macro-level check can see that. `macro_live` is the shape to copy — it compares `_staging('raw.catalog_machinemodel')` against the physical table and asserts `cabinets` carries none of the three excluded columns, so it names the affected view rather than a fixture. Breaking the liveness half also fires `namesake_count_disagree`, `models_has_deleted`, `title_size_disagree` and `title_size_zero_on_live`, all of which name a real view and column. Pin the behaviour the macro is _relied on_ for, not the shape it happens to have: `patch_number_of` was written against a four-digit width and silently truncated a five-digit id until its check said what the parse was for.

**Source free-text earns a column; a field the catalog already models does not.** `ipdb_notes`, `ipdb_notable_features`, `ipdb_toys`, `ipdb_marketing_slogans` and `opdb_features` are plain columns on `models` because they're genuine unmodeled signal — fields IPDB/OPDB carry that flipcommons doesn't surface, and mining them is common analysis work, so a hand-rolled `json_extract` in every consumer is the thing to prevent. The test for any other raw `extra_data` field is whether it _shadows something the catalog already models_: if so, use the modeled form and leave the source buried — the IPDB trade name defers to `manufacturer_name`, `opdb.keywords` defers to the modelled `themes`. The long tail (`opdb.common_name`, `opdb.description`, …) stays unsurfaced until an analysis needs it; promoting one is a single line here.

When adding a new relationship view, match it to one of the [model relationship shapes](README.md#model-relationship-shapes) rather than inventing a fifth. A payload-bearing relationship should follow the counted-payload grain of `model_gameplay_features` rather than be flattened to a name-list, which would drop the payload.

**Entity views are the other exception, and they are exhaustive.** Every first-class catalog entity gets a view whether or not anyone has asked for one, because the argument that carves aliases out of demand-driven promotion is not about aliases — it is about absence being indistinguishable from non-existence. That failure recurred on entities: two sessions running analyses read a missing view as a missing Django field and reported `Actor` and `ChangeSet` as concepts the system did not have. Neither raised a promotion request, for the same reason the country-map and reward-type campaigns didn't.

So the split is by KIND of view, not by demand:

- **Entity grain — exhaustive, with no exemptions.** One view per first-class entity. `unexposed_entity` derives the entity set structurally (a `catalog_*` table carrying both `slug` and `status`, which selects exactly the concrete `LinkableModel`s) and fails for one that is not exposed, with `stale_entity_view` and `missing_entity_view` closing the other two directions. There are no exemptions: `_entity_view` has no way to opt out.
- **Derived, relationship and measure views — demand-driven.** `model_edges_bidir`, `model_number_collisions`, the vocabulary DAG columns. There is no bound on the questions these answer, so inventing them speculatively is how a foundation grows surface nobody reads. This applies to whole views that compute something new, not to a table's own columns — those are covered by `* EXCLUDE` above.

A projection that reads the physical table independently is a second definition waiting to drift, so build it over the view instead — `_ce_location` reads `corporate_entity_locations`, not `catalog_corporateentitylocation`; the staging layer above is where that bottoms out. A one-predicate slice usually shouldn't be a view at all: `countries` and `country_aliases` were deleted once `locations.is_country` existed, because narrowing columns and renaming keys made them traps rather than conveniences.

**`entity_registry` and `entity_subjects` are GENERATED — don't hand-edit `entity_registry.sql`.** `manage.py export_entity_registry` (`make codegen`) walks every concrete `LinkableModel` and writes both. The file is committed, because this layer has to run with no Django environment, and loads ahead of `catalog.sql` in the manifest — the vocabulary has to exist before anything speaks it. Adding a catalog entity needs no SQL edit.

Two things make it codegen. Entity NAMES are declarations, not derivations: `machinemodel` is spelled `model` and `corporateentity` is spelled `corporate-entity`, and no string rule gets you there, so a map in SQL would be a second source of truth. And SQL cannot iterate table names — the same limit `_dim_vocab` works around — so the 21 `UNION ALL` branches have to be written by something. `unresolved_claim_subject` covers both ways a subject fails to resolve: a type absent from the registry, and a vanished subject row.

**Entity types are spelled the way the app spells them.** `subject_type` holds `person`, not `catalog.person`. The content-type spelling survives in exactly one join predicate, in `claims`, where `entity_registry.django_label` translates it.

**A view that EMITS a subject type reads `_entity_type_of('<physical_table>')`; it does not spell one.** Only `credits` does — its subject is a MachineModel XOR a Series, so it cannot inherit the value the way the `patch_*` views do. A literal there fails silently in the direction that matters: rename the vocabulary and `credits ⋈ claims USING (subject_type, subject_id)` drops from 426,614 rows to the 21 Series credits, because a join returning too little still returns rows. A stale filter literal turns the self-test red; a stale emitted one does not. Key on the physical table: a view emitting a subject type has already joined it.

Alias lookups are the exception to demand-driven promotion: expose every concrete `AliasModel` so an undiscoverable catalog mapping is not rebuilt in consumer SQL. Each alias view has one row per alias of a live parent, includes the parent id and stable key, and leaves the stored value unnormalized; `location_aliases` uses `location_path` because location slugs are only parent-scoped. Keep abbreviations separate because they are community shorthand, not alternate names. `unexposed_alias_table` catches a new physical alias table with no view, but it cannot detect a view that exposes only part of that table, so review must verify complete exposure.

## The provenance layer

[`provenance.sql`](sql/provenance.sql) loads after the catalog layers; [`provenance_checks.sql`](sql/provenance_checks.sql) defines `_provenance_checks`, which `foundation_checks.sql` folds into `foundation_checks`.

- **The agreement checks are the price of the `rank` column.** It reimplements the winner-pick, so the only thing keeping it honest is comparing it against what the resolver materialized — `gameplay_feature_resolution_disagrees`, `theme_resolution_disagrees`, `year_resolution_disagrees`, covering both the membership and scalar register shapes. A fourth register in the ranking needs a fourth agreement check; dropping one drops the justification for the column.
- **Derive the member/scalar split structurally.** A `|` in the `claim_key` means identity parts, which means a relationship member. The value shape can't be used — `claim_presence.py` documents that a claim-controlled JSON scalar may itself be a dict with an `exists` key. `member_claim_nondict_value` and `scalar_claim_exists_flag` assert both directions.
- **`value_text` is the column to predicate on; `value` is the raw JSON.** JSON keeps `"500"` apart from `500` and both write paths are in the data, so of the 73 claims asserting `production_quantity = 500`, `value = '500'` finds one and `value = '"500"'` finds 72. `value_text` folds both, then folds `''` to NULL as `_blanks_null` does. NULL on members and list claims: `json_extract_string` would otherwise serialize a member payload back to `{"exists":true,…}`, reading as a scalar on 58,178 rows that have none. It lives in the `_json_scalar_text` macro so `_fx_claim_value` can state it against input we control.
- **`_provenance_checks` is private** so the runner's sweep doesn't report every provenance failure twice, once on its own and once through `foundation_checks`.
- **Declared check names live in `*_checks.sql` files, below each file's first checks view.** `check-mutations` collects them per `sql/*_checks.sql` file, from that file's first `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW …checks` to end-of-file — so a check declared in a non-checks file is invisible to the coverage sweep, and a view-name literal placed above a file's first checks view stays out of it.
- **Views bind at `CREATE`**, so `citation_roots` must follow the views it aggregates.
- **`changesets` is built on `raw.provenance_changeset`, and must stay that way.** Deriving it from `claims` would be shorter and is wrong: 739 changesets wrote no claim at all — they only retracted — and `claims.changeset_id` names only changesets that wrote, so every one of them would vanish. That is the gap the view exists to close, and it closes silently if someone "simplifies" the FROM clause. `changeset_rows_dropped` compares the view against the physical count, and `inert_changeset` asserts the other half (a changeset that neither wrote nor retracted did nothing at all). The same reasoning applies to anything else built on top: aggregate from `changesets`, not from `claims` grouped by `changeset_id`.
- **An actor is an ingest source XOR a user, and `actors` is where that is stated.** `actor_name`/`actor_slug` coalesce across the two kinds so nothing downstream branches on `actor_kind` to attribute a claim — which is only safe while the XOR holds, hence `actor_backing_unresolved` (exactly one backing row) and `actor_slug_collision` (the two namespaces share `actor_slug`). `_claim_actor` is a projection of `actors` rather than a second decode, so the two cannot drift; keep it that way, and keep the count columns out of it so a `claims` scan doesn't pay for them.
- **`shared_hosts` is GENERATED — don't hand-edit `shared_hosts.sql`.** `manage.py export_shared_hosts` (`make codegen`) writes it from `SHARED_HOSTS` in `apps/citation/shared_hosts.py`, and the manifest loads it ahead of `provenance.sql` because DuckDB binds a macro's table references at `CREATE` and `_shared_cdn_host` reads the view. It is codegen for the reason `entity_registry` is: the declaration is Python with no database row behind it, so nothing in SQL can reach it at query time. What makes it worth the channel rather than a retyped list is the shape of the drift. The list gained `facebook.com` and the copy here did not, and only the loud half surfaced — a check firing on a path-scoped row this layer still thought illegal. The silent half is that a host this layer calls ordinary keeps its **bare** recognition row eligible, so `citation_root_for_url('https://www.facebook.com/anything')` returned the "Facebook" root while the app resolved it to nothing: an analytics layer disagreeing with the product about who published the evidence, with every check green. The parity test in `test_export_shared_hosts.py` is the guard, because `make codegen` is local and CI doesn't run it. Only the TABLE travels — the label-boundary suffix rule stays hand-written beside the other mirrors of `hosts.py`.
- **The `root_*` family travels together, and `root_family_incomplete` enforces it.** Any view carrying `root_citation_source_id` carries the name, the slug and `root_identifier_key` too. This is a coverage rule rather than a style preference because a partial family fails in the direction of a confident wrong answer: a consumer that can reach the root's id and display name but not its stable key does not go and join, it substitutes `citation_source_type`, and filtering IPDB as `type = 'web'` sweeps in every other web-rooted work. Three views were partial when the rule was written, in three different ways — a missing column, a column spelled without the prefix (so grepping the family name found nothing and read as "it doesn't exist"), and a grain view that only ever carried two of the four.

## The data patch layer

[`data_patches.sql`](sql/data_patches.sql) loads after `provenance.sql`; [`data_patches_checks.sql`](sql/data_patches_checks.sql) defines `_data_patch_checks`, which `foundation_checks.sql` folds into `foundation_checks`. Same private-view arrangement as the other layers, same reasons.

- **It is a projection of provenance, not a second source.** Every view here reads `claims`, `changesets` or `citation_instances`. It reads nothing from `fc` directly and must stay that way — the patch lens narrowing to a different population than the provenance layer describes is the drift this ordering exists to prevent.
- **The read order is a three-link chain now.** `data_patches.sql` binds provenance views, which bind `models`. Views bind at `CREATE`, so a reorder fails loudly — but a layer added on top of this one inherits the whole chain, not just the last link.
- **A layer's checks read its own views and the ones below.** `patch_entry_spans_subjects` scans `_patch_acts`, which this layer defines, so it lives in this layer's checks file. Putting it in `provenance_checks.sql` left the provenance self-test binding a view from the layer above it, and meant `provenance_checks.sql` could no longer be read by anything that had read only `provenance.sql`.
- **`patch_entries` is the grain that matters, and `any_value` is load-bearing there.** A patch entry is one ChangeSet, so the view reaches for its subject rather than grouping by it — grouping would split a changeset that ever spanned two subjects into two rows and quietly halve the blast radius of a citation, which is the one thing the view exists to state correctly. `patch_entry_spans_subjects` asserts the assumption instead of the view assuming it. It must scan `_patch_acts` and not `patch_claims`: narrowed to assertions it goes blind to retraction-only entries, which is the same defect `changesets` was repaired for.
- **Aggregate from `changesets`, never from `claims` grouped by changeset.** The rule from the provenance layer applies here with teeth: an entries view built from assertions alone misses 737 of 4798 entries and seven whole patches.
- **Nothing here derives an edit cutoff.** `patch_number_of` exists so an _operator-supplied_ one can be applied ad hoc. Which patches may be edited is not a fact this database holds, and an analysis that decides it for itself decides it wrongly.

## Every public view declares its own one-liner

A public view ships with a `COMMENT ON VIEW` immediately after its `CREATE`:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW titles AS …;
COMMENT ON VIEW titles IS
  'One row per live Title — identity, franchise/series grouping and n_models. …';
```

That comment **is** the view reference. `scripts/analysis/analysis describe` reads it from the session, so README.md does not duplicate the view list — and a term naming nothing exactly searches these one-liners, so the words you choose are how the view gets found at all. `undocumented_view` fails the self-test for any public view without a comment; review remains responsible for keeping the comment accurate, while `DESCRIBE` supplies the live column list.

Two mechanics worth knowing:

- **The `COMMENT ON` must immediately follow its own `CREATE OR REPLACE`, not precede it and not sit in a block with its neighbours'.** Replacing a view or macro drops its comment, silently. Keeping each pair adjacent is what makes that a non-issue.
- **Write the grain first, then the guidance** — `describe` prints these as a list, and the grain is what tells `model_edges` from `model_edges_bidir` at a glance. Reasoning that needs more than a sentence goes in the comment block above the `CREATE`, not here.

Macros work the same way and carry the same obligation: a `COMMENT ON MACRO` under each `CREATE OR REPLACE MACRO`, enforced by `undocumented_macro`. `describe` lists them after the views, with their signatures.

Private `_underscore` helpers take no `COMMENT ON`; they aren't reference surface.

They do have a placement rule, because `_` covers three different things and only the first is a layer:

- **Staging layer** — the `stg` schema in `staging.sql`, one view per lifecycle table read from more than one view. No dependencies, so it loads ahead of everything.
- **Shared helper** — a collapse or a pre-aggregate several views join (`_ce_location`, `_mfr_status`, `_model_target`). Goes at the head of the section whose public views it feeds, not next to whichever one happens to read it first.
- **Local step** — one consumer, a few lines above it (`_dm_lines` into `_dm_marked` into `domain_vocab`). Stays adjacent; hoisting it would only separate it from the thing that explains it.

A shared helper read from OUTSIDE its own section says so in its comment. `_title_live_n` is the one, and the reason to flag it is that its two consumers agreeing is a property of there being one definition — an edit that looks local moves both.

`model_edges` being outbound-only is stated in both its comment block and README, deliberately — it is the one trap that returns a confident wrong answer rather than an error. Don't trim it as a duplicate.

## Where a view lands in the reference

`describe` groups the foundation under the `═══ §N` section header each definition sits below, in `§N` order. Both come out of `raw._relation_index`, built by [`sql/relation_index.sql`](sql/relation_index.sql).

```sql
-- ═══ §10 MODELS ═════════════════════════════════════
```

- **The number is the display rank, and it is free to disagree with load order** — which is the point, since load order is define-before-use order and puts the plumbing ahead of the spine. Keeping the rank inside the header is what stops it drifting from the label it ranks: they are one string, edited together.
- **Numbers run in tens**, so inserting a section costs one line rather than a renumber.
- **A file with no headers is not a special case** — give it one. `audit.sql` and `data_patches.sql` each carry a single header, and the two generated files emit theirs from their management command.
- **A header with no `§N` still groups, after every numbered one.**

Attribution is per file and purely local — a header owns every `CREATE` below it in the same file, never one in another manifest entry. Two files may share a `§N` and label, which lists them as one section: `catalog.sql`'s `_entity_type_of` sits under the same `§100 ENTITY VOCABULARY` header the generated `entity_registry.sql` emits. The catalog drives the final join, so a name the parse picks up that is not a real relation (a private helper, a `stg.` view) matches nothing and drops out. A relation the parse misses lists under `UNGROUPED`.

## Public and runtime surfaces are contracts

Analyses outside this repo rely on the surfaces below — Flippatch's data patch campaign files are the current consumers, and none of them are exercised by anything here. Changing one can break those consumers while the self-test and mutation harness remain clean.

- **Public view and column names.** `models`, `model_edges`, `target_*` and the rest. Treat a rename the way you'd treat one in an API: it needs the consumers updated in the same breath, not discovered later by a campaign that returns zero rows.
- **The `patch_*` views specifically.** They were promoted out of a campaign-local layer in flippatch, which deleted its copy in the same breath. The campaign that drove the promotion (0189, print citations) has since finished, so as of 2026-08-13 there is no known live consumer — but the general hazard stands: a column dropped here surfaces as a campaign emitting nothing, in the other repo, with nothing in this one failing. Re-check who is reading them before treating that as freedom; "no consumer" is a claim with a date on it.
- **ATTACH aliases.** The runner owns **`fc`** (the baked snapshot, attached read-only into every analysis session), `snapshot` owns **`snap`** (its output file), and the layer bake owns **`lyr`** (its output file, during the bake only). Those are reserved; everything else in the `ATTACH` namespace belongs to the layers above, which claim their own — Flippatch's evidence bridge takes `ev` for pinexplore's web-scrape cache, its external-data-source layer takes `eds` (the baked artifact, in its generated shim) and `px` (pinexplore's `explore.duckdb`, at bake time). The sql/ files themselves may never ATTACH or name a catalog: their names stay catalog-relative so the same files build the snapshot, a scratch copy or an in-memory session. Don't add a foundation attachment without checking it against what the consumers have already claimed, and don't assume an alias is free because nothing in this repo uses it.

The runner discovers public `*_checks` and `*_context` views by name, so those suffixes are load-bearing across repos. A foundation view that happened to end in `_checks` would silently join every consumer's gate.

## Sister-repo layers are baked, the way the foundation is

A LAYER is a sister repo's analysis program heavy enough that re-executing it per session is the wrong cost model — Flippatch's external-data-source comparison is the one that exists. The runner's `ensure_layer` bakes it exactly as `ensure_snapshot` bakes the foundation: run once when an input changes, opened read-only ever after. The pieces, and why each is shaped the way it is:

- **Registration is a directive, not a registry.** A `-- layer: <manifest>` line in any file the analysis `.read`s (transitively) is what the runner scans for after `resolve_and_cd`. This repo carries the mechanism and no knowledge of who uses it; the registration travels with the layer, so the dependency arrow between repos stays one-way.
- **The manifest is KEY=VALUE** (`name`, `alias`, `build_entry`, `artifact`, `shim`, `stamp_paths`), every path relative to this repo's root — the frame every runner path already resolves in. The manifest stamps itself, so editing the registration also rebakes.
- **The stamp is (snapshot stat, stamp_paths tree, manifest, `layer_build_format`).** The snapshot file's own mtime+size is the foundation's contribution: every rebuild renames a fresh file into place, so the stat IS the stamp. Bump `layer_build_format` when the bake recipe changes shape.
- **The bake materializes public relations as TABLES** — views don't travel across ATTACH (the `snapshot` command's reasoning) — with each COMMENT carried over, in creation order. It costs two loads of the layer's source: SQL cannot iterate relations (the same limit `browse` works around), so one load enumerates and one copies.
- **The generated shim is how sessions see the layer.** One pass-through view per baked table (`CREATE VIEW x AS FROM <alias>.x`), generated FROM the artifact so the two cannot disagree, renamed into place BEFORE the artifact so a crash between the two leaves a stale-stamped artifact (rebaked next run) rather than a fresh-stamped one behind a stale shim, which nothing would ever repair. Because the pass-throughs land in `memory` under their own names, gate, `describe`, summary and `*_context` discovery all work unchanged.
- **A layer's `*_checks` verdicts are bake-time facts**, the way `raw._check_results` holds build-time ones: the check views bake as row-tables over the same content the session reads, so the gate's "live" count of a pass-through is a count of those verdicts. A check that inspects view _definitions_ (Flippatch's boundary check) ran against the real definitions during the bake, which is the only place they exist.
- **Freshness is guaranteed only through the runner.** A raw `duckdb` session reads whatever the last bake produced — the same caveat the foundation snapshot already carries.

`snapshot` copies tables into its attached output file, so the `.duckdb` holds plain tables — not the session's views, which reference catalogs the output file will not have once detached. For the same reason the analytical views stay non-`TEMP`: the DuckDB UI runs each query cell on its own connection, and `TEMP` views aren't visible across connections. Don't "tidy" them to `TEMP`.

## Domain semantics belong to DomainModel.md, not here

`domain_vocab` **reads** [DomainModel.md](../../docs/DomainModel.md) at query time — one row per controlled-vocabulary term, with the prose definition — so an analyst filtering `production_status_slug = 'one-off'` can join to find out what that means, and the doc stays the only place a domain fact is written.

The division of labour is worth holding onto, because the pull is always toward restating: **DomainModel.md owns what a term means; `catalog.sql` owns what will mislead your query.** Grain, liveness spelling, non-uniqueness, outbound-only — those are properties of the lens, true nowhere else, and they belong here. If a comment you're about to write could be a sentence in DomainModel.md, link to it rather than copying it down; a second copy is a second thing to keep true.

Four checks hold the two in agreement, in both directions — `undocumented_vocab` catches a live term the doc never defines, `stale_vocab_doc` catches a definition for a term that isn't live, and `unmapped_vocab_dim` / `stale_vocab_dim` guard the `_dim_vocab` hand-list.

The doc shape relied on is a bullet of the form **`-` + backticked slug + `:` + definition**, grouped by the nearest bold entity lead-in or `##`/`###` heading, with the group snake-stripped to the `catalog_<dim>` table suffix. Rename a heading and every bullet under it detaches — which surfaces as every slug in that vocabulary reported undocumented at once, plus `stale_vocab_dim`. Loud, never silent.

## Liveness is spelled in the opposite dialect from the ORM, on purpose

`catalog.sql` writes live as `status IS DISTINCT FROM 'deleted'` — a **denylist**. The ORM's `.active()` writes it as `status = 'active' OR status IS NULL` — an **allowlist**. README says `models` matches how the read APIs behave, and today that is true, but it is true by _coincidence_: the two spellings are extensionally identical only while the `EntityStatus` domain is exactly `{active, deleted, NULL}`.

A third member splits them, silently and in opposite directions — the denylist fails **open** (the new status appears in `models`), the allowlist fails **closed** (it vanishes). Neither spelling errors, and no row-level invariant can see it, which is why `status_unknown` exists: it asserts the domain rather than assuming it, and it is what licenses the spelling used here. Don't remove it to "simplify" the liveness filters.

If it ever fires, **don't mechanically port `catalog.sql` to the allowlist.** The right answer depends on what the new status means: an archived cohort may well belong in `models` for analysis even though the product hides it — surfacing the odd cohort is often the whole job — or it may not. Deciding now, in the abstract, would bake in exactly the kind of unchosen cutoff the section above warns against. The check preserves that choice; porting early spends it.

Coverage of the liveness filter is generated rather than trusted: the dim list `catalog.sql` live-filters is swept against the physical column list of `catalog_machinemodel`, so **a new dim FK on the model fails `uncovered_model_dim`** instead of silently going unfiltered and unchecked. Adding a dim means adding its live-filtered join, not just its column.

## Why the catalog is imported rather than attached

The `raw` schema of `backend/db.analytics.duckdb` is an import of `backend/db.sqlite3` into DuckDB's own storage, rebuilt by the runner whenever the source — or any sql/ file — changes. It would be simpler to `ATTACH` the SQLite file directly, and that is what this layer did until it produced two silent wrong answers.

DuckDB's sqlite scanner gets the following wrong, and the liveness predicate is what makes the shape common enough to matter.

```sql
-- WRONG. Returns cabinets' count for BOTH rows; the second table is never scanned.
SELECT 'cabinets' AS v, count(*) FROM raw.catalog_cabinet WHERE status IS DISTINCT FROM 'deleted'
UNION ALL SELECT 'game_formats', count(*) FROM raw.catalog_gameformat WHERE status IS DISTINCT FROM 'deleted';
```

When two branches of one query aggregate over different attached-SQLite tables and their pushed-down projection and filter are textually identical, the optimizer treats the scans as equivalent and evaluates one of them. `SET sqlite_debug_show_queries=true` shows a single `SELECT "status" FROM "a" WHERE ROWID BETWEEN ? AND ?` issued for both branches. Every simple dim view is that shape, because every one of them selects the same columns under the same liveness predicate.

Measured on DuckDB v1.5.5 / `sqlite_scanner` f79b1db: it hits any aggregate, not just `count`; every branch, not only the second; and scalar subqueries, `OFFSET 0`, `threads=1` and `disabled_optimizers` all fail to avoid it. Two things are safe, and between them they explain why it stayed hidden: **row-level unions** (`SELECT slug FROM a … UNION ALL SELECT slug FROM b …` is correct, which is why `entity_subjects` and `_dim_status` were never affected), and **branches whose filter literals differ** — it needs the branches to agree, and the liveness predicate is the one thing every view spells identically.

**Importing removes the class entirely.** The hazard remains only for a SQLite file you attach yourself — an evidence bridge, a scratch comparison. Two shapes are safe there: aggregate over a union of labelled rows (what `foundation_summary` does — don't "simplify" it back, though note a zero-row relation then drops out rather than reporting 0), or wrap each branch in `WITH x AS MATERIALIZED (…)`, which is close to free.

It was found in two places, both publishing wrong numbers with every check green: `foundation_summary` reported one vocabulary's count for another's, and the dark-column sweep that has since been removed reported one view's liveness for three others. Assume any analysis in a sister repo that tabulates per-table counts this way has the same defect.

## Changed a view that reads a physical table? Sweep its columns

```bash
scripts/analysis/analysis columns <view>   # or --all
```

Per column: rows, NULLs, empty strings. Two things it catches, both of which a row-level invariant cannot see — a column holding `''` (absence spelled the wrong way; the rule here is that absent is NULL, and `live`/`_blanks_null` are how that is applied), and a column entirely NULL, which is either a facet the catalog does not hold yet or a decode that broke.

**It is a command and not a check, deliberately, and this is the more interesting half.** Written as a gate the same measurement needs an exemption list, and every formulation lands there. The data-based form — no public view column may hold `''` — needs one hand-written `UNION` branch per view, since `query_table()` takes literals only and SQL cannot iterate relations, plus a meta-check to keep that list honest, plus an exemption for `citation_root_domains.path_prefix` where `''` legitimately means "whole host". The text-based form — no view may carry a bare `fc.` reference — needs no iteration at all and would catch an unwrapped join that the data-based one misses, but 38 of 68 views carry one, so it needs 38 exemptions. Roughly 60 entries one way, 38 the other. At that size the exemption list is the maintenance burden rather than the coverage, which is what retired the dark-anchor sweep. The rows here are a worklist for a reader, not an invariant, and `path_prefix` at 116 of 118 is the case that shows the difference: a gate must excuse it, a reader just reads the number.

One blind spot to know: `n_blank` cannot see a blank inside a list element — `['a','']` casts to `[a, ]`, never `''`. Zero such values today, so it is latent, and list-typed facets are exactly where a reader would assume coverage.

## Editing the foundation? The rebuild runs its self-test

Every edit to a sql/ file triggers a rebuild on the next runner invocation, and the rebuild evaluates every checks view and stores the verdicts — so the self-test runs whether or not you ask for it, and a bare `query` warns on stderr when something is failing. The readout is:

```bash
scripts/analysis/analysis run foundation
```

Prints a row-count-per-view health readout, then fails if any invariant broke — two classes: data-independent structural checks (union integrity, grain, the live filter, the `model_edges` license/source contract, subject + target resolution) and coverage meta-checks that fail when a new entity, alias table or view is added without the exposure the layer promises. No check logic leaks into `catalog.sql`; the checks live in the `*_checks.sql` files beside it.

## Editing the runner? Its tests are deselected by default

`backend/scripts/tests/test_analysis_runner.py` covers the runner itself — what `browse` materializes and how `describe` groups it — and each of its three tests builds a foundation from scratch, so `backend/pytest.ini` deselects the `analytics` marker they carry and a bare `pytest` skips them. Ask for them by name:

```bash
cd backend && uv run pytest -m analytics -n 0
```

`-n 0` because they share one build through a session fixture, which every xdist worker would otherwise repeat. `scripts/test-backend` runs them as a second pass, and a pre-push hook runs them on any backend or analysis change — CI never does, having no DuckDB CLI. They build from a migrated-but-empty catalog, so they also fail when a migration moves a column the sql/ files read.

## Editing the checks? Mutation-test them

```bash
scripts/analysis/check-mutations          # all mutations
scripts/analysis/check-mutations title    # only those whose name matches
```

`scripts/analysis/check-mutations` breaks the catalog on purpose — one way per line of [`catalog_mutations.tsv`](catalog_mutations.tsv) — and asserts the check that should notice actually does. Takes well under a minute.

This exists because of a failure mode specific to check code: **a broken check and a passing check both return zero rows.** "It returned nothing on healthy data" is not evidence a check works — it is exactly what a no-op does, so a green self-test can sit on top of guarantees that quietly evaporated. NULL comparisons are a common cause, hence the house rule at the top of `foundation_checks`: compare with `IS DISTINCT FROM`, never `<>`, and null-test operands before any ordering operator. The harness proves what the rule can only ask for.

Adding a check? Add a line breaking what it guards — the harness **enforces** that, in both directions, so a check can't ship unproven and the spec can't rot after a rename. It also fails on a filter that matches nothing (otherwise a typo yields a green run that tested nothing).

What it enforces is one mutation per CHECK; what a check needs is one per FAILURE MODE, and the gap between those is not covered by anything. A closed-enum check fails two ways — a value outside the set, and no value at all — and only the first is reached by substituting garbage. The second is the one that goes quiet: `v NOT IN (…)` is NULL on a NULL `v`, a NULL predicate selects nothing, and a view reading through `_blanks_null` hands a blank column over as exactly that NULL. Six such checks were each proven by a single off-vocabulary mutation while the absent half of all six was unpoliced. So when a check's predicate has a shape that can go three-valued, mutate the absent case too, and write both mutations before the fix.

A dirty baseline doesn't abort the run — the checks split into two temperaments, and the harness respects the line. Structural checks fire only when foundation code breaks; domain-sync checks (`undocumented_vocab`, `stale_vocab_doc`) fire on healthy-data drift, and a drifted doc says nothing about whether `union_integrity` would notice a broken join. So a check already firing at baseline **BLOCKS** its own mutations — it would "confirm" them even if their SQL did nothing — and its noise is subtracted from every other probe, leaving the rest of the suite trustworthy. A blocked check is loudly reported and stays unproven until `analysis run` is green again; the everyday gate is where drift keeps its teeth.

The mutation should fail _before_ your check exists. Write it first, watch it report `SURVIVED — defect unnoticed`, then add the check and watch it turn `ok`. A mutation written after the check, against the check, tends to describe what the check does rather than what the defect is.

`CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` drops the view's comment, so nearly every mutation trips `undocumented_view` as a side effect rather than as the defect under test. `check-mutations` excludes that check from its miss-path diagnostic; the filtered fast path is untouched, so `view comment dropped` still proves it fires. Don't add `COMMENT ON VIEW` boilerplate to mutations.

## Cost

**Adding views to the foundation is effectively free; the self-test is where cost lands.** Views are lazy DDL — loading the whole schema costs the same no matter how many views it defines, and a query pays only for the ones it touches. The one place a new view costs something is the `*_checks.sql` files, whose evaluation at build time is the most expensive thing in the analysis layer.

`_catalog_checks` therefore opens with a block of **`WITH … AS MATERIALIZED` CTEs** that shadow the foundation views by name, so each is decoded once for all the checks rather than once per reference. Build new catalog checks on those names, not on `main.`-qualified views. The rationale for lazy-view-plus-materialized-at-use (rather than a real table at initialization) is in the comment there.
