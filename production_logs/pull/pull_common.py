"""Shared plumbing for the pull scripts: credentials, day windows, HTTP, merge, manifest.

The pullers are archivers, not parsers. Rows are written to disk exactly as the
service hands them down; a row is only ever *looked at* for its timestamp (to
bucket it into a UTC-day file) and its identity key (to merge re-pulls without
duplicates). Interpretation belongs to production_logs/analyze/sql/.

Exit taxonomy, shared by every puller:

    0  success, including a day the vendor has nothing for
    1  transport failure after retries, or a verification mismatch
    2  preflight: missing credential or bad --start/--end, before any network call
