-- Railway edge HTTP access logs.
--
-- SOURCE: ../../dumps/railway/http.*.ndjson, one JSON object per request, the
-- GraphQL httpLogs row written verbatim.
--
-- One row per HTTP REQUEST as Railway's edge saw it, with status, timing and
-- client -- an outage as users met it rather than as the app narrated it. A 502 is
-- the edge failing to reach the container, so it appears here and leaves no
-- application log line at all.
--
-- The puller merges on requestId into one file per UTC day, so rows are unique
-- by construction; a request appearing in two files would be a day-bucketing
-- bug, and `http_duplicate_request_ids` fires on it. A deployment legitimately
-- spans several day files.
--
-- DURATION UNITS. totalDuration is edge-observed round trip and upstreamRqDuration
-- is time in the container; both are MILLISECONDS. A request that never reached
-- the container still has a totalDuration, so filter on status before reading
-- latency.

COMMENT ON TABLE railway_requests IS 'GRAIN: one row per HTTP request seen by Railway''s edge, merged by the puller on requestId. Shows outages as users met them -- a 502 never reaches the app and so leaves no container log line. `is_synthetic` marks this project''s own probes; railway_health and timeline exclude them, this relation does not. `is_abandoned_write` marks a request whose client gave up at the CDN mid-body, leaving the origin writing into a socket nobody drains: it logs 200 with a multi-second total_ms and a ~1ms upstream_ms, so a latency scan surfaces it as an origin stall that it is not. Distinct from `is_client_abort`, which is a 499 at Railway''s own edge.';
