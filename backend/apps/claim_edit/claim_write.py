"""Domain-agnostic interactive claim-write engine.

The generic core of the PATCH claims path: validate scalar fields, then
write a list of :class:`ClaimSpec` atomically as an attributed ChangeSet,
attach citations and trigger resolution. Binds the loose
``ClaimControlledModel`` — its caller has already resolved the row, so it
needs nothing about addressing.

The concrete, per-relationship spec-builders that feed it ``ClaimSpec``s
live alongside the domain endpoints in :mod:`apps.catalog.api.edit_claims`.
This module imports no catalog symbol at all; the app-layer spine enforces
``claim_edit ⊄ catalog``, keeping the engine a generic write surface
reusable across domains. See docs/AppBoundaries.md.
