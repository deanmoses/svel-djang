"""The aggregating registry for citation types and schemes.

The single place core code (models, recognition, ingest, API) reads types and
schemes from. Citation types remain explicitly registered first-party product
concepts. Schemes are auto-discovered plugin declarations: a module under
``schemes/`` exports one conventional ``SCHEME`` value, and the registry imports
those modules in deterministic key order. The model's CHECK-constraint value
lists derive from these registrations, so a new scheme flows into
``makemigrations`` instead of a hand-edit.
