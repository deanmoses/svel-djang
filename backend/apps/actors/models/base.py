"""``ActorModel``: the abstract base every actor-backing model inherits.

Inherited *downward* by satellites that live in higher app tiers — ``User``
(accounts) and ``Source`` (provenance). ``apps.actors`` therefore must never
import those classes; the registry discovers them via ``__subclasses__()`` at
runtime (Django has imported every model by app-ready). Same direction as
``LinkableModel`` / ``core.entity_types``.

The base owns the mint-on-create + sync-on-update of the backing record's
``Actor`` row, deriving the resolution fields from per-instance hooks each
satellite implements. The hooks read the satellite's editable ``priority`` /
``is_enabled`` columns, making ``Actor`` a continuously-correct mirror of them.
This mirror is permanent: the satellite columns are the per-type editing surface
and Actor is the uniform resolution read-model.
