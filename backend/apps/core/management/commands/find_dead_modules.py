"""Find module-level dead code and code kept alive only by tests.

Vulture treats a reference from a test as a use, so in a highly-tested codebase
it goes quiet exactly where rot hides. This command answers the harder question
using grimp (the static import graph that backs import-linter):

  * DEAD       — modules nothing imports at all (not prod, not tests).
  * TEST-ONLY  — production modules reachable *only* through test code. These are
                 kept alive solely by their tests; deleting the code and its test
                 together is usually safe.

It is module-granularity and static-only (see caveats below), so treat the
output as a triage list, not a delete list.

Seeding
-------
Django loads many modules by string/convention (INSTALLED_APPS, signal
autodiscovery, the ``{app}.api`` router autodiscovery, string-referenced
middleware), which the static graph can't see. Because this is a management
command, Django is fully booted, so we seed the production entrypoint set from
the live app registry and settings rather than guessing — then walk the import
graph upstream from those seeds to get everything genuinely reachable in prod.

Caveats
-------
* Module-granularity: a module can be reachable in prod yet still contain a dead
  *function*. For function-level "alive only by tests", use coverage over a
  production run, not pytest.
* Static-only: a module reached purely via ``importlib``/string from app code
  (not a known Django convention) will look dead. Eyeball before deleting.
