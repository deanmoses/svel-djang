class FlipAdminSite(admin.AdminSite):
    """Admin site that disables every Django-password surface.

    Staff authenticate through WorkOS via the main app; Django's ``User.password``
    field is inert (no live code consumes it). Three overrides close the surfaces
    the stock site exposes:

    * ``login`` — redirects to WorkOS instead of rendering the password form
      (the only brute-forceable login surface on the backend).
    * ``password_change`` / ``password_change_done`` — 404. Lets nobody set a
      password that could silently become an auth surface if a future feature
      reintroduces ``authenticate(username=..., password=...)`` (DRF basic
      auth, an emergency escape hatch, etc.).

    Overriding the methods (instead of only the URL patterns) means any caller
    that does ``super().<method>(...)`` from a future subclass is covered by
    the same policy, and the URLs stay reverse-resolvable so admin templates
    that reference them by name don't ``NoReverseMatch``.
