    The soft-delete walker (``apps/core/soft_delete.py``) classifies each
    inbound reference to a lifecycle model as protect-block,
    owned-child-rides-along, cascade or usage-block, and trusts — without
    verifying — that the classification is total and consistent. This check
    verifies it, moving these failure modes off the delete-time request path to
    boot:

    - ``core.E110`` — an inbound FK/O2O whose ``on_delete`` the walker does not
      handle. Today this is a ``NotImplementedError`` raised inside
      ``_iter_protect_referrers`` the first time such an entity is deleted.
    - ``core.E111`` — a ``soft_delete_usage_blockers`` entry naming a reverse FK
      accessor already covered by the PROTECT pass (redundant; double-reports).
    - ``core.E112`` — a reverse M2M membership or self-referential hierarchy from
      a lifecycle model not declared in ``soft_delete_usage_blockers``; such a
      reference is invisible to the FK PROTECT pass, so an active referrer would
      slip past delete-blocking.
