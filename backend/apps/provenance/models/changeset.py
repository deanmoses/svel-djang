    """A grouped edit session that links related claims.

    A ChangeSet is a thin grouping record, not a snapshot of entity state.
    Truth is always derived from claim resolution (highest priority wins).
    Reverting a claim means deactivating it and re-resolving — the
    resolution machinery picks the correct winner from whatever remains.

    All claims in a ChangeSet share the same ``actor``. ``ingest_run``
    discriminates batch (ingest) from interactive edits — interactive
    ChangeSets carry an ``action`` and a user-backed actor, ingest ones
    don't; both invariants are enforced by ``changeset_writer.record_changeset``.
