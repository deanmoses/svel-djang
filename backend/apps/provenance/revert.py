"""Per-field claim revert logic, plus whole-ChangeSet undo.

Two inverse operations live here:

* :func:`execute_revert` deactivates **one** user claim. This is what
  surfaces on the edit-history page as a per-field Revert button.
* :func:`execute_undo_changeset` atomically inverts **every** claim in a
  single DELETE ChangeSet. This is what powers the post-delete Undo toast —
  one click restores a Title plus every cascaded Model in one unit of work.

Keeping them separate protects the per-claim contract (validation,
ownership, blast radius) from the different eligibility rules that apply
to a whole-changeset undo.
