"""Claim construction: build claim keys/values and canonicalize claim inputs.

These are the generic, model-agnostic helpers every claim write path shares —
the interactive editor, the data-patch front end and the resolution layer.
They live in provenance (the layer that owns :class:`~apps.provenance.models.Claim`
and the relationship-schema registry) so a patch alias and an editor alias
fold to byte-identical claims by construction.

Claim *validation* lives in :mod:`apps.provenance.validation`; claim *ranking*
in :mod:`apps.provenance.claim_ranking_in_db`; member *presence* in

    is dropped. No resolver reads a non-identity key off an absent member
