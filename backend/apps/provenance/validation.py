class MemberSpec:
    """One member key in a relationship claim's value dict.

    A member is authorable, materialized target data — the FK or literal that
    the through-row *is about*. Every member is required in a positive claim
    (there is deliberately no ``required`` field): absence within an XOR
    ladder is expressed *in the value* — ``null`` for a nullable FK, ``""``
    for a literal — never by omitting the key.

    ``name`` is the key as it appears in the value dict. ``identity``, when
    set, is the label used in the canonical ``claim_key`` identity parts —
    typically equal to ``name`` (e.g. ``"person"``) but occasionally different
    (e.g. ``identity="alias"`` for ``name="alias_value"``). ``None`` means the
    member carries claim data without contributing to the claim key (a
    non-identity member — e.g. a label whose wording is data *on* the edge,
    not the name *of* it). Identity members are required in tombstones too;
    non-identity members are stripped from them.

    ``display_key`` names a sibling *payload* spec whose value is this
    member's user-facing rendering — e.g. ``alias_value`` declares
    ``display_key="alias_display"`` so resolvers and display engines both
    read the override from one declaration. See
    ``register_relationship_schema`` for the cross-reference invariants.

    ``max_length`` (string members only) carries the target ``CharField``
    length bound, derived from the model at registration. It is consumed by
    the data-patch adapter, which must reject an over-long member at
    plan-build time: SQLite (the patch author's local DB) silently ignores
    ``CharField(max_length=...)``, so an over-long string would pass every
    local check and only fail as an ``IntegrityError`` on Postgres in prod.
    ``None`` for FK members.

    positive claims only; tombstones carry identity members + ``exists``

    ``max_length`` / ``min_value`` / ``choices`` carry model-derived bounds
