    Reassigning a live reference *onto* an entity this patch soft-deletes leaves a
    dangling reference: post-apply, a live row points at a soft-deleted entity.
    The committed delete-blocker (``plan_soft_delete``) can't catch it — it
    enumerates rows that point at the target *now*, but a row this patch reassigns
    onto the target doesn't point there yet, so it's absent from the enumeration.
    This build-time guard closes the hole by construction, at the FK-claim level —
    no resolver, so it adds no predict-vs-actual divergence.

    The guard is **syntactic**: it fires on the FK claim *target*, not the
    resolved post-patch FK. So it also rejects a few coherent-but-pointless shapes
    (an FK claim that loses resolution; a referrer itself deleted in the same
    patch). All are the one contradiction — point-at-X and delete-X in one file —
    and rejecting them is the strict, defensible choice.
