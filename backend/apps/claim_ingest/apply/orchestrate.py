"""The orchestrator: ``apply_plan`` drives one ingest plan through the pipeline.

This is the ingest **back end**: it turns the ``IngestPlan`` intermediate
representation into batched database writes. The data-patch compiler is its only
front end today, but it stays source-agnostic by design — new source behavior
belongs in a front end against the IR, never as a fork here.

Wires the package's stages in order — structural validation (:mod:`.validate`),
then entity creation + claim build/diff (:mod:`.persist`, :mod:`.claims`) and
persistence inside one transaction, with the ``IngestRun`` audit row created
*outside* it so a failure survives rollback. This module owns transaction
structure and run bookkeeping only; the per-stage logic lives in the leaf
modules.
