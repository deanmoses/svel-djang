"""Cloudflare R2 manifest-download helper for the data-patch pull command.

Used by the ``pull_patches`` management command.
Pulls are manifest-driven: a ``manifest.json`` lists ``{path, size, sha256}``
entries; this downloads the files a caller wants and verifies each checksum.

Uses only stdlib (``urllib.request``) so it works on Railway's slim Python image.

    ``dest/local_prefix + entry["path"]``. When ``needed_files`` is given, only

    ``ignored``); when ``None``, every entry is downloaded.

    several doesn't break the whole pull. Pass ``required=True`` when this is the
