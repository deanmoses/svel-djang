"""Scrub user PII out of a restored production dump, and keep dev logins working.

Run by ``scripts/prod-to-sqlite.sh`` against the local Postgres container holding the
freshly-restored prod dump, *before* ``dumpdata`` hands the data on to the local
SQLite dev DB.

Running before ``dumpdata`` keeps PII out of everything that outlives the run, and
keeps the ``--natural-foreign`` references self-consistent — ``User.natural_key()``
is ``(email,)``, so the dump's FK references are generated from the scrubbed
addresses. It does not make the container it runs against clean: a logical scrub
leaves the originals in storage, which is why the script discards that container
rather than keeping it (its header explains).

Three jobs:

1. Every non-consenting user is scrubbed — email, name, password hash and WorkOS
   link. Rows are never deleted: provenance and ``Actor`` FKs depend on them, and
   the username is the public identity (``/users/<username>``), not PII.

2. Every session is deleted. ``session_data`` carries the pending-signup payload
   — email, first and last name — in cleartext, and a production session is
   useless against a local dev site.

3. The consenting developers' WorkOS link is carried forward from the db.sqlite3
   being replaced. Prod's ``workos_user_id`` values belong to the *prod* WorkOS
   environment and can never match what a local sign-in returns, so importing
   them unchanged locks the developer out: the id lookup misses, the email
   lookup finds an active row bound to a different id, and
   ``workos_match._refuse_active_email_collision`` refuses the login. Replacing
   them with the ids from the outgoing local DB makes the first branch match on
   the very next sign-in.
