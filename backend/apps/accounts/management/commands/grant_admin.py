"""Promote an existing user to Django admin (is_staff + is_superuser).

Bootstrap path for the WorkOS-only login policy (see
``apps.core.admin_site.FlipAdminSite``): sign up via WorkOS as a regular
user, then run ``manage.py grant_admin <email>`` to grant admin access.
The admin password form is disabled, so the legacy
``manage.py createsuperuser`` flow produces a row that can never sign in.
