"""Helpers for computing Location paths and deriving child location types.

Location is the only catalog entity whose URL identity is multi-segment
(``location_path = "usa/il/chicago"``) and whose child type is implicit
in its parent's ``divisions`` list. These helpers centralize the two
derivations so the create routes, the read serializer, and the test
suite all agree on one rule.
