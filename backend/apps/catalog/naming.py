"""Name normalization for catalog duplicate-prevention.

The normalization rule MUST stay in lockstep with the TypeScript copy at
``frontend/src/lib/naming.ts``. Both implementations are covered by a shared
case table; update both and both tests in the same change.

Rule (applied in order):

1. Unicode NFKC, lowercase, casefold.
2. Replace any run of characters that is not an ASCII letter or digit with a
   single space.
3. Strip leading articles: ``the``, ``a``, ``an``.
4. Collapse runs of whitespace and strip edges.

The empty string is a legal output and indicates a name with no
name-bearing characters at all.

Known limitation: NFKC compatibility decomposition expands some decorative
codepoints into letters, so e.g. "Godzilla™" normalizes to "godzillatm"
rather than "godzilla". This is an acceptable trade for the benefit of
folding full-width and composed forms to their ASCII equivalents, which is
the more common case in pinbase's catalog. Revisit if real titles surface
with decorative marks.
