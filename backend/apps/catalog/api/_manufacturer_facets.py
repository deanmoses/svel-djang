"""Server-side faceted filtering for the manufacturers listing page.

Its own explicit ``filtered`` / ``facet_counts`` assembly, calling the shared leaves
in ``engine/query/facet_helpers.py``. The games listing calls those same leaves from a
different assembly — the card-grain roll-up engine (``_game_rows.py`` +
``_game_facets.py``), which cards a Title or a Model per row where manufacturers stay
one row per manufacturer. Only the leaves are shared, so this assembly is free to
diverge wherever manufacturers genuinely differ.

Like the games fan-out, it applies one narrower per dimension (:func:`filtered`),
serves the page result via :func:`ordered` and assembles the sidebar option lists in
:func:`facet_counts`. Its exclude loop is uniformly N-1 where the games fan-out's is
not: every ``MfrFilters`` field is single-valued, so every click *replaces* the current
selection, while the games listing's accumulating dimensions stay applied in their own
counts (``facet_exclude``). Where manufacturers genuinely differ from a title/model
listing:

- **Filter side anchors at the model through the CE:** ``entities__models`` (a
  manufacturer's models hang off its corporate entities). The active-non-variant
  ``_MODEL`` guard rides every model-level narrower; counts root at the
  ``MachineModel`` model with the bare ``_MODEL_COUNT_GUARD``.
- **Location** is a dual pair: the count rolls a Chicago count *up* into Illinois/USA
  (``hierarchy_rollup``); the filter selects a chosen ``location_path`` *down* into its
  descendants (path-prefix match). Both run under the active-CE guard. Location roots
  at ``CorporateEntityLocation`` (location hangs off the CE, not a model), so its count
  uses the active-CE guard, not ``_MODEL_COUNT_GUARD``.
- **Year is span-overlap**, not "a model inside the range": two separate
  ``.filter()`` calls (``__lte=year_max`` AND ``__gte=year_min``) so different models
  can satisfy the two bounds.
- **Person uses the active-non-variant model guard** — a person whose only credit is
  on a retired or variant model is excluded.
- **``model_count`` is a filter-independent ``Subquery``** (the card's total
  active-non-variant model count, and the "most prolific first" sort key) —
  ``Coalesce``-d to 0 so a manufacturer with no such models reads 0 and sorts last.

The ``q`` predicate (the subtle part):

- It matches the **manufacturer name + its own aliases unconditionally**, and **CE
  names, CE aliases and location names (+ ancestors) only via active CEs**. The
  active-CE guard is therefore **per-term, inside the CE-reached branches**, never a
  global ``AND`` — a global guard would drop a manufacturer with no active CE from a
  pure *name* match (**the global-guard trap**, named again at :func:`_apply_q`).
  **Location matching is depth-unlimited** (the shared ``ancestor_map``), so it
  agrees with the location *facet* counts: a CE nested 5+ deep still matches a
  top-country ``q`` — the correct behavior (a country search should find all its
  manufacturers), and pinned by a test.
- **Each guarded CE branch is an ``Exists`` subquery rooted at the CE-side model**,
  not an outer ``.annotate(Lower(Unaccent(F("entities__name"))))`` + a separate
  ``entities__status`` guard. Rooting the match and the active guard in one
  subquery ``WHERE`` keeps them on the *same row* — the same separate-join trap the
  count leaves avoid. An outer multi-valued annotation + a sibling guard could let
  an **inactive** CE's name match while a **different** active CE satisfied the
  guard. The manufacturer-own terms (name, own aliases) are unguarded, so they stay
  as a plain outer annotation / own-alias ``Exists``.
- **Diacritic fold, two mechanisms, two backend behaviors**:
  the SQL-folded fields (name, own aliases, CE names/aliases) fold via
  ``LOWER(UNACCENT(...))`` on **Postgres** and fall back to bare ``icontains`` on
  **SQLite**. The **location** term can't be a SQL fold — it matches a location's name
  *or any ancestor's*, and ancestor names aren't an annotatable field — so it resolves
  in **Python** via ``_fold`` on **both** backends. Net dev-only asymmetry on SQLite:
  ``q=montreal`` matches a Montréal *location* but not a diacritic manufacturer
  *name*. Invisible in production (Postgres → every branch folds). Punctuation is not
  folded either way.
