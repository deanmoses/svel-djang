"""Soft-delete planning and execution for user-deletable catalog entities.

A user "delete" in this system is a ``status=deleted`` claim at user priority
rather than a DB row removal. The walker below enforces the spec's cascade
rules (see docs/plans/RecordCreateDelete.md §Cascade Behavior):

* CASCADE to an independent lifecycle entity — write ``status=deleted``
  claims for each active child in the same ChangeSet. Modeled here by an
  opt-in ``soft_delete_cascade_relations`` attribute on the parent model,
  because the DB FK may itself be PROTECT (e.g. ``MachineModel.title``).
* CASCADE to an owned child row with no lifecycle — do nothing. The child
  rides with the parent's visibility.
* PROTECT, referenced by an active independent entity — block. The user
  must resolve the reference before the delete can proceed.
* PROTECT, referenced only by soft-deleted (or non-lifecycle) entities —
  allow. The DB-level PROTECT stays as a safety net against hard deletes;
  this rule is enforced here, at the application layer, because the DB
  can't see ``status=deleted``.

The walker is generic over any entity with ``EntityStatusMixin``. Title is
the first caller; Model Delete and the rest will plug in by declaring
``soft_delete_cascade_relations`` on their models.

Some lifecycle references aren't visible through the reverse-FK pass: M2M
through-rows (``MachineModelTag``, ``MachineModelTheme``, …) and
self-referential hierarchy (``Theme.parents``, ``GameplayFeature.parents``)
hop through an intermediate table that itself has no lifecycle. Models
that care about those "usage" references declare them explicitly via
``soft_delete_usage_blockers``, a frozenset of reverse-manager names to walk
for active referrers — closing the gap between "no FK PROTECT breakage
at the DB" and "no active lifecycle entity still references me at the
application layer".
