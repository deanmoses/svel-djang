"""Card-grain listing rows — the Title ➡ Model ➡ Variant roll-up engine.

The row engine behind ``GET /api/games/``: one row per *card*,
where a card is a Title when every one of its live Models matches the
Model-only dimensions (rung 1), else one card per matching Model (rung 2),
with a Variant absorbed into a matching parent (rung 3).

Rows only — serialization and the wire contract live in ``games.py``, and the
facet fan-out at card grain in ``_game_facets.py``, both built on this
module's two sets and rungs. The filter vocabulary is the full listing set,
by semantics class:

- ``manufacturer`` / ``person`` / ``technology_generation`` / ``display_type`` /
  ``system`` / ``tag`` — single-valued Model-only (``tag`` over the M2M: any
  of a Model's tags may match)
- ``player_count`` — bucketed Model-only (``6`` means "6 or more", via the
  shared ``_bucket_q``)
- ``themes`` / ``gameplay_features`` — multi-select Model-only (AND of ORs,
  descendant-expanded)
- ``reward_types`` — multi-select Model-only (AND, no hierarchy)
- ``edge`` — multi-select Model-only (AND, no hierarchy): relationship keys
  with an optional ``:in`` direction suffix (``_edge_vocabulary.py``); an
  unknown key matches nothing
- ``year_min``/``year_max`` — range, Model-only
- ``franchise`` / ``series`` — Title-only, binding all of a Title's Models
- ``q`` — the record-local shared class (name + abbreviations), tested on the
  record being decided and propagating in neither direction
- ``display_subtype`` / ``technology_subgeneration`` /
  ``corporate_entity`` — single-valued Model-only, **hidden**
  (``surfaced=False``): honored from the query string with full roll-up
  semantics, but no sidebar control and no facet counts.
  ``technology_subgeneration`` matches the Model's own FK *or* its system's
- ``cabinet`` / ``game_format`` / ``production_status`` — sparse Model-only
  (**OR** of the supplied values): vocabulary slugs plus the reserved
  :data:`UNCLASSIFIED`, which matches a null field. A bare slug stays exact;
  the sidebar's default selection sends the two-value preset built by
  :func:`preset_values`

The two-set split is the engine's load-bearing invariant: **unanimity is
measured over** :func:`model_only_models` **(Model-only dimensions alone),
never over** :func:`carding_models` **(that plus the shared class)**. Feeding
``carding`` into the unanimity count silently inverts the intended grain
(``q=Ice Fever`` would return the Ice Fever Model where the Title card is
specified) — a plausible-looking wrong answer, not an error.

Rows come from :func:`game_rows_merged` — two queries merged and ordered in
Python (the ``_count_manufacturer`` precedent: ~7k-row scan + rollup). Two
properties of that seam the rest of the engine depends on: ``count`` is the
built list's length, so it can never drift from what the page slices, and the
ordering runs on a diacritic- and case-folded name key in Python, so it does
not vary with the database's collation.
