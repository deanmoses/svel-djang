"""Shared helpers for user-driven catalog record creation.

Title Create was the first instance of the pattern; Model Create is the
second. These helpers were extracted once a second caller existed to
prove the shape fits more than one entity. Subsequent record types (Person,
Manufacturer, …) should reuse these rather than copy-pasting.

What lives here:

* Slug format validation (regex + length).
* Generic name / slug availability pre-checks parameterized by model class
  and an optional scope filter (for entities whose collision rules are
  scoped, e.g. Model names are scoped to parent Title).
* A ``create_entity_with_claims`` wrapper that owns the transactional unit
  of work: row creation, ChangeSet + claims, and TOCTOU-safe translation
  of a DB unique-constraint violation into a field-level slug error.

What does not live here: name normalization (see ``apps.catalog.naming``),
rate limiting (see ``apps.provenance.rate_limits``), or the claim
machinery itself (see :mod:`.edit_claims`).

    rule is shared with the frontend so the UI's "search returned zero
    results" signal and the API's enforcement stay in sync.

    *scope_filter* narrows the collision set. ``None`` means "all active
    records" (Title). For Model, pass ``Q(title_id=title.pk)`` so two
    titles can legitimately share a model name.

    *friendly_label* is the noun shown to the user, e.g. "title" or
    "model": "A model named 'Pro' already exists."

    *include_deleted* extends the collision scan to soft-deleted rows.
    Required for any entity whose ``name`` column is DB-unique (e.g.
    ``System.name``, ``Manufacturer.name``): a name that collides with a
    soft-deleted row would otherwise pass this pre-check and trip the DB
    unique constraint, which ``create_entity_with_claims`` misreports as a
    slug collision. With this flag set, the collision surfaces as a
    field-level name error before the insert is attempted.

    The alias-collision scan below does NOT follow ``include_deleted`` —
    it continues to filter ``parent__status=active``. Aliases have their
    own uniqueness (per-parent), separate from the parent ``name`` UNIQUE
    constraint, so they don't contribute to the IntegrityError this flag
    exists to prevent. If a future entity needs alias collisions against
    soft-deleted parents to count, extend both scans together.

    When *model_cls* exposes an ``aliases`` reverse manager (Theme,
    GameplayFeature, RewardType, …), aliases of active parents also count
    as collisions — the spec requires aliases to behave like alternate
    names for duplicate-prevention purposes. See
