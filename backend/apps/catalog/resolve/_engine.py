"""Catalog-free resolution primitives.

The shared kernel between *rank*
(:func:`apps.provenance.claim_ranking_in_db.ranked_claims`) and the per-shape
desired/diff/write logic: the layer-2 winner-pick (:func:`pick_winners`), the
layer-3 reconcile (:func:`reconcile`), the typed vocabulary they speak
(:class:`Projection`, :class:`Delta`, …) and the generic, shape-agnostic
:class:`ThroughRowProjection` that implements :class:`Projection` for every
plain/payload/compound through-row namespace.

Deliberately catalog-free — it imports only provenance (+ the Django ORM) and
names no concrete catalog model (through models arrive as constructor
arguments) — so it can move wholesale to ``apps.provenance.resolution``. An
import-linter contract pins that boundary. The *bespoke* projections
(:class:`~._relationships.AliasProjection`, :class:`~._media.MediaProjection`)
and the concrete builders that configure :class:`ThroughRowProjection` name
domain models and live in ``_relationships.py`` / ``_media.py``, never here.
