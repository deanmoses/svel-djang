"""The generic spec→projection bridge: ``build_through_projection``.

One data-driven function reads a through-model's :class:`ClaimRelationshipSpec`
(declared as a ClassVar, paired with its subject in a
:class:`ClaimRelationshipBinding`) plus Django ``_meta`` and instantiates the
configured :class:`~._engine.ThroughRowProjection` — replacing the hand-written
``_*_projection`` builders for every explicit-ClassVar relationship shape
(themes, tags, reward types, gameplay features, credits, abbreviations,
corporate-entity locations, and the self-referential parent hierarchies).

Catalog-free by construction: it names no concrete catalog model (every domain
fact comes from the binding + ``_meta``) and imports only the engine kernel and
the provenance vocabulary, so it belongs to the would-be-movable resolution
core. Only the bespoke ``AliasProjection`` (case-folded keys) stays hand-written
in :mod:`._relationships`.
