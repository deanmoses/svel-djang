    Alias values are stored and compared in lowercase (matching the

    Claims live on the *parent* object, not on the alias row itself.

    Subclasses must add:
    - A ForeignKey to the parent model (named after the parent, related_name="aliases")
    - A UniqueConstraint on Lower("value") with a table-specific name
    - ``alias_claim_field``: the claim namespace on the parent that carries
      alias values (e.g. ``"theme_alias"``). Enforced at class creation
      via ``__init_subclass__``; read by ``discover_alias_types``.

    ``AliasModel`` does not bundle ``TimeStampedModel``. Row-level
    timestamps are an independent choice per subclass — the meaningful
    "when was this asserted" lives on the originating claim, not on the
    alias row. Existing concrete aliases all inherit ``TimeStampedModel``
    by convention, but a future alias subclass could opt out.
