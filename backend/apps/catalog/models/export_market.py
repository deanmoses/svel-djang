"""ModelExportMarket: claim-controlled export-market rows on machine models.

The join table behind "built for export to [market]". Each row records one export
destination for a subject MachineModel at one of three resolutions: a seeded
country (``target_market_location``), a free-text region label
(``target_market_label``, e.g. "Europe") when the market is not a single
country, or neither — the bottom rung, where the row's existence records
"built for export" with an unknown destination.

A model's rows take exactly one of three shapes: multiple
country rows, a single label row, or a single unknown row. The DB enforces
the per-shape uniqueness below; the "a null-location row must be the model's
only row" mix rule is a write-path invariant (the editor planner enforces it —
SQLite can't express the cross-row CHECK), not a hard DB constraint.
