"""ModelRelationship: typed, claim-controlled edges between machine models.

The edge table behind copies, conversions and conversion kits. Each row relates a
subject MachineModel to a target at one of two resolutions: a seeded machine
(``target_machine``) or a free-text descriptor (``target_label``, e.g.
"several Gottlieb EM models") when the donor isn't seeded. Licensing status is
an orthogonal payload axis, so "bootleg" is ``(copy, unlicensed)`` rather than
its own relationship kind.
