"""Generate scripts/analysis/sql/entity_registry.sql from linkable models.

The analytics layer's copy of the entity registry. Two DuckDB objects:

- ``entity_registry``: one row per entity, carrying every identity fact the
  model declares — ``entity_type`` and its plural, the content-type label, the
  table and the ``public_id_field``. Translates the public vocabulary to the
  two Django-internal spellings SQL can see.
- ``entity_subjects``: one row per ``ClaimControlledModel`` entity, keyed
  ``(subject_type, subject_id)``.
- ``entity_prose``: one row per (live entity, markdown field), the authored-prose
  corpus. Its field set comes from :func:`apps.core.markdown.get_markdown_fields`,
  the same ``MarkdownField`` introspection the save path uses, so a second prose
  field on any model joins the corpus with no SQL edit.

All three are generated because SQL cannot iterate table names, so adding an
entity needs no SQL edit.

Run via ``make codegen``.
