"""End-to-end check that ``IGNORE_ERRORS`` actually suppresses events.

Boots Sentry with the same ``ignore_errors`` list ``settings.py``
uses in production plus a recording transport, then captures
instances of each ignored class and an unrelated class. The
ignored classes must produce zero envelopes; the control class
must produce one. A regression where the list is overwritten or
the SDK changes its filter semantics fails this test.

Also pins the ``StructuredApiError`` subclass invariant — see
``test_all_structured_api_error_subclasses_are_4xx`` below.

    subclass would silently disappear from the issue stream — the
    opposite of what we want for "the server actually broke."

    during pytest setup, so production subclasses are all reachable
    via ``__subclasses__``). If you add a 5xx ``StructuredApiError``
    subclass, this test fails — either fix the status, or refactor
    the ignore list to enumerate the 4xx subclasses explicitly
