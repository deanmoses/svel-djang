"""JSON log formatting for Railway's log explorer.

Railway assigns each log line a ``severity`` it can filter on. For a plain-text
line that severity comes from the stream it arrived on — stdout becomes
``info``, stderr becomes ``error`` — and Python's ``StreamHandler`` writes to
stderr, so unformatted INFO and WARNING lines arrive tagged as errors and
``severity:error`` matches nothing but noise. A line that is valid JSON is read
instead of its stream, and its ``level`` field becomes the severity, which is
what this formatter emits.

The handler's stream is left at the ``StreamHandler`` default, stderr. Once a
line is JSON its ``level`` decides the severity, so the stream that carried it
stops mattering and moving these logs to stdout would not reclassify them.

See https://docs.railway.com/guides/logs for the normalization rules.
