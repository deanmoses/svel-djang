//     covers the bundled JS and SvelteKit's inline hydration script.
//     PostHog and Sentry SDKs ship in the bundle (`npm install`), not via
//     CDN, so no third-party host is needed in script-src.
//   - `style-src 'self'` plus an explicit sha256 of app.html's inline
//     <style> block (see computeAppHtmlStyleHash). SvelteKit's hash/
//     nonce machinery only covers styles it injects itself; hand-written
//     <style> in the app.html template is invisible to it, so the hash
//     has to be added by hand. SvelteKit hashes its own injected inline
//     styles in prerendered pages and nonces them in SSR'd pages. This
//     strict form is report-only — see cspStyleReportOnlyDirectives.
//   - `img-src 'self' https: data:` is intentionally permissive. Catalog
//     images come from img.opdb.org, media.flipcommons.org, and other
//     hosts surfaced by ingest pipelines; locking img-src to a fixed list
//     fails loudly the first time a new host appears, and <img> tags
//     have negligible XSS surface.
//   - `connect-src` is the Sentry origin derived from PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN
//     (so regional DSNs like o12345.ingest.us.sentry.io are handled
//     correctly — a wildcard like `*.ingest.sentry.io` would NOT match
//     those) plus PostHog's api_host. PostHog's external chunk loads
//     (session-recording.js, surveys.js, /flags) are all disabled in
//     lib/analytics/config.ts — us.i.posthog.com (the dedicated US
//     ingestion subdomain that PostHog recommends as api_host) is the
//     only host the SDK actually contacts. When no DSN is configured the Sentry
//     entry is omitted; the runtime SDK is also inert in that case.
//   - `frame-ancestors 'none'` prevents other origins from framing us
//     (the modern equivalent of X-Frame-Options: DENY in Caddyfile, kept
//     for old browsers). `frame-src 'none'` because we don't embed
//     anything ourselves.
//   - report-uri (not report-to) because Sentry's documented CSP endpoint
//     uses the older format and browser support for report-to is uneven.
//   - `upgrade-insecure-requests` is added in the enforced block below
//     rather than here, because it is a navigation directive rather than
//     a fetch directive and only applies to production builds — it
//     upgrades http:// subresource URLs to https://, which our code
//     already uses everywhere, but breaks plain-HTTP localhost.
