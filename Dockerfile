# node:*-slim variants ship without ca-certificates. Node's own HTTPS uses
# its bundled CA roots and works fine, but tools that shell out to the OS
# trust store (notably sentry-cli, invoked by sentrySvelteKit during
# sourcemap upload) fail TLS verification with "unable to get local issuer
# certificate" against ingest endpoints. Install ca-certificates so any
# such tool can reach the public internet over HTTPS.

# Install pnpm directly rather than through Corepack, which resolves pnpm's bin
# to a hardcoded path pnpm no longer uses and cannot install the platform
# executable pnpm 12 ships as an optional dependency. Keep this version in sync
# with frontend/package.json#packageManager: `pmOnFail: ignore` in
# frontend/pnpm-workspace.yaml means a mismatch is not reported.

# Copy source and build. RAILWAY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA is auto-injected by Railway

# Sentry sourcemap upload happens during `pnpm build` (sentrySvelteKit
# plugin). The plugin's autoUploadSourceMaps gate in vite.config.ts is
# truthy only when all three of these are non-empty, so without them the
# build silently skips the upload and browser stack traces stay
# minified in production. Multi-stage Docker doesn't inherit host env
# vars into build stages; Railway passes service-scoped vars as build
# args, but only for ARGs the Dockerfile declares — hence the explicit
# declarations here. Defaults are empty so local/CI Docker builds without
# Sentry secrets still succeed (the upload just no-ops).

# PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN is consumed at build time by svelte.config.js to

# for the runtime Sentry SDK. Same Railway-build-arg rule applies as
# above: without an explicit ARG declaration the variable never
# reaches `pnpm build` and the report-only CSP silently degrades to
# nothing (the malformed-DSN guard in svelte.config.js throws if it's
# set but unparseable; an empty value is treated as "unconfigured").

# SITE_ORIGIN is baked into prerendered canonical URLs and OG tags at
# build time via svelte.config.js prerender.origin, and is read at
# runtime by /sitemap.xml and /robots.txt. Same Railway-build-arg rule
# applies as above: without an explicit ARG declaration the variable
# never reaches `pnpm build` and prerendered HTML silently ships
# localhost URLs. Empty (the default) means the svelte.config.js
# localhost fallback applies, so local/CI Docker builds without the var
# still work; the build-phase gate in svelte.config.js refuses Railway
# builds where the var is unset.
